    <h4>Description</h4>
    <p>When peeling the skin of this particular fruit, you have to be very careful not to let the liquid from the tip to stain the fruit or your bare hand. The liquid will cause a whole other world of itchiness. It is recommended to use a glove or wrap your hand with a plastic bag while peeling the skin. Also, bear in mind not to wash the fruit after peeling the skin off to prevent the fruit from becoming dark in colour during the pickling process.</p>
